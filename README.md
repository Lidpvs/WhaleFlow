# WhaleFlow 🐋📈
### BTC whale spikes vs price movement (Data Science / ML project)

WhaleFlow explores whether **large Bitcoin whale transactions** correlate with **future BTC price movements**.

The project aggregates on-chain whale activity, merges it with market data, and evaluates whether **price tends to move after whale spikes** across multiple time horizons.

The repository includes:

- on-chain whale transaction aggregation
- time-series feature engineering
- statistical impact analysis
- a machine learning baseline model
- an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**

---

# Dashboard

## Quick stats

![Quick stats](assets/quick_stats.png)

Shows dataset size, spike count, and ML training summary.

---

## Horizon comparison

![Horizon comparison](assets/horizon_comparison.png)

Comparison of strategy performance across multiple horizons (1–12 hours).

Metrics shown:

- number of trades
- average trade return
- hitrate
- cumulative strategy return
- mean returns after whale spikes vs normal hours

---

## Whale spikes vs BTC price

BTC price chart with whale spike markers.

Spike hours represent the **largest whale transaction flows**.

# Project Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Whale transaction aggregation
Large Bitcoin transactions are extracted and aggregated hourly.

Features include:

- whale_tx_count
- whale_sum_btc
- whale_max_btc
- whale_mean_btc

A **spike hour** is defined as the **top 10% of whale transaction flow**.

---

### 2️⃣ Feature engineering

Additional features:

- whale_sum_3h (3-hour rolling whale flow)
- spike_cluster (recent spike activity)
- volatility regime
- trend regime

---

### 3️⃣ Impact analysis

Statistical tests compare:

future returns after spike hours
vs
future returns after normal hours


Bootstrap resampling is used to estimate **95% confidence intervals**.

---

### 4️⃣ Machine learning baseline

Model used:

Logistic Regression


Target:

Will BTC price increase within N hours?


Training setup:

- TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation
- feature scaling
- class balancing

Evaluation metrics:

- Accuracy
- F1 score

---

# Example findings

Some horizons show stronger effects than others.

Short-term horizons around **4–7 hours** showed the most promising signal in this dataset.

However, the project is intended as an **exploratory research prototype**, not a trading system.
